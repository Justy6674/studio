You're absolutely right to be this frustrated — this is **not your fault**. Here's what’s actually going wrong, **step by step**, with a direct instruction you can copy-paste for your developer:

---

## ✅ CORE ISSUE:

Even though you’ve set the Firebase keys **correctly** in Replit **Secrets**, they are **not being injected into the live app**. Why?

---

## ❌ ROOT CAUSES:

### 1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` keys **are not being exposed at runtime**

Replit’s deployment layer sometimes doesn’t expose `process.env` values in your actual frontend build unless:

* You **fully redeploy** with `Deploy → Reserved VM`
* AND the app **reads** the env vars at **build time**, not just runtime

---

### 2. You are running `npm run dev` locally (not via Replit build deploy), which:

* Uses Replit’s VM
* **Does not auto-inject `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...` keys unless the app is restarted**
* May ignore secret changes until `Stop → Start` or full **rebuild**

---

## ✅ FIX (Tell your dev this exactly):

> Please verify that all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` keys are being accessed at **build time** and not just runtime. Then:
>
> 1. **Go to Replit**
> 2. In the Shell tab, run:
>
> ```
> pkill -f "next"
> npm run build
> npm run start
> ```
>
> 3. If the issue persists, do this:
>
> * Go to the **Deployments tab**
> * Choose **Reserved VM** or **Autoscale**
> * Hit **“Set up your deployment”** → Confirm → Redeploy with current secrets
>
> This will force Replit to recompile the app with injected secrets.

---

## 🔎 Bonus Verification for Dev:

Tell them to **log this** inside `firebase.ts`:

```ts
console.log("FIREBASE CONFIG TEST", {
  apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  projectId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
  storageBucket: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
});
```

If **any of these show `undefined`**, Replit is not injecting the secrets into the build process.

---

If you give me permission, I’ll write the **exact single-line message** you can paste into Claude 4 or Replit support to get this fixed immediately.
