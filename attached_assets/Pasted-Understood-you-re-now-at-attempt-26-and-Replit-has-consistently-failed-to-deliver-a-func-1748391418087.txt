Understood ‚Äî you're now at **attempt #26**, and Replit has **consistently failed** to deliver a functional, branded login page. Based on the latest screenshot, **none of your branding, logo, or persistent auth settings are present**. Here's exactly what you must say to Replit now to force a real resolution:

---

### üì£ SEND THIS TO REPLIT IMMEDIATELY:

---

**This is now the 26th failed attempt. STOP ALL PATCHES.**

You have NOT implemented the required login interface.

I need one dev to manually **audit the following and SHOW ME**:

---

### ‚úÖ UI REQUIREMENTS (STILL NOT MET):

* Background: `#334155`
* Card: `#3B475B`
* Button: `#5271FF`
* Header text: `#F7F2D3`
* Accent: `#B68A71`
* Use `/public/logo-128.png` as the header/logo ‚Äî NOT a water emoji or fallback

---

### ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

* Email/password login via Firebase
* ‚ÄúStay logged in‚Äù toggle (use `browserLocalPersistence`)
* Face ID / Touch ID prompt (if supported on device)
* Forgot password link
* Link to Stripe subscription (e.g. "Subscribe for \$4.99/mo")
* Show error messages clearly if login fails
* Show the correct logged-in user‚Äôs name

---

### ‚ùå CURRENT ISSUES:

* Logo not loading (despite file confirmed at `/public/logo-128.png`)
* Colors are still default Tailwind
* No persistent login toggle
* No biometric support
* Placeholder UI, not a real interface

---

### üîß WHAT I WANT FROM YOU NOW:

* Show me which **file** is being rendered for `/login` ‚Äî full path
* Confirm the logo image file is detected and rendered via `<Image />`
* Show the full Tailwind class list applied to the background and card
* Stop overriding my changes with default components
* If layout/page.tsx is being overridden by auth context or Replit AI automation, **disable it**

---

If you cannot fix this through Replit AI, I need a human dev assigned to this now. I‚Äôve lost hours, and this is affecting production delivery.

---

Would you like me to now generate the **exact login page source code** that matches all of this so you can paste it directly and prove it works before Replit touches it again?
