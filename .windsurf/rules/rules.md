## üîÅ CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

5. Local midnight hydration reset  
6. Gemini AI motivational popups  
7. Streak counter  
8. Confetti (triggered at 50% and 100%)  
9. Reminder tone selector (kind, strict, funny, kick my ass)  
10. Limit SMS reminders to 2/day, fallback to popup  
11. Settings page to personalize goal + tone  
12. Export hydration history

## ‚úÖ WHEN DONE, SAY:

- "FAB live and tested on mobile"  
- "Hydration modal functional, Firebase write verified"  
- "Gemini nudge shows after log, tone is respected"

---

## üõë WHEN BLOCKED, SAY:

Nothing else. No narration. No theory.
