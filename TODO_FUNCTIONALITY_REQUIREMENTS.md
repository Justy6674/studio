# 📋 **TODO: WATER4WEIGHTLOSS FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS**

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST**

### ✅ **CORE REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications** as the PRIMARY app feature (SERVICE WORKER ✅, FCM CLIENT LIBRARY ✅, API WORKING ✅)
- ✅ **Notifications MUST include device vibrations** (CUSTOM PATTERNS FOR EACH TONE IMPLEMENTED ✅, SMARTWATCH SUPPORT ✅)
- ✅ **Notifications must trigger unpredictable nudges** based on:
  - Hydration patterns (CLOUD FUNCTION sendHydrationReminder DEPLOYED ✅)
  - Inactivity intervals (FREQUENCY LOGIC IMPLEMENTED ✅)
  - Hydration streak milestones (STREAK TRACKING IMPLEMENTED ✅)

### ✅ **USER CUSTOMISATION & TONE:**
- ✅ **Allow users clear and intuitive settings** in-app to fully manage push notification preferences (NOTIFICATIONSETTINGS COMPONENT IMPLEMENTED ✅):
  - ✅ Easily enable/disable notifications completely (FCM TOGGLE IMPLEMENTED ✅)
  - ✅ Precisely select and switch notification tone via UI toggles (ALL 8 TONES IMPLEMENTED ✅):
    - "funny" ✅ (😂 Lighthearted and humorous)
    - "kind" ✅ (😊 Gentle and encouraging)
    - "motivational" ✅ (💪 Energetic and inspiring)
    - "sarcastic" ✅ (🙄 Witty with a playful edge)
    - "strict" ✅ (🧐 Direct and authoritative)
    - "supportive" ✅ (🤗 Caring and understanding)
    - "crass" ✅ (💥 Bold and unfiltered)
    - "weightloss" ✅ (🏋️‍♀️ Focused on weight management)
  - ✅ Notification frequency must be clearly user-settable (minimal, moderate, frequent) (ALL 3 FREQUENCIES IMPLEMENTED ✅)

### ✅ **DYNAMIC GEMINI AI CONTENT:**
- ✅ **Notifications MUST be generated exclusively by Gemini AI**, always unpredictable, creative, fresh, and non-repetitive (generateMotivationalMessage CLOUD FUNCTION DEPLOYED ✅)
- ✅ **Prompt logic implementation** (strictly follow this pattern) (EXACT PATTERN IMPLEMENTED ✅):

```javascript
const prompt = `
  Generate a short, ${userTone}-toned push notification encouraging ${userName} to hydrate right now.
  User consumed: ${currentMl}/${dailyGoalMl} ml today.
  Current streak: ${currentStreak} days.
  Ensure each message is unique, engaging, and NEVER repetitive.
`;
```

### ✅ **FULL GAMIFICATION:**
- ✅ **Implement visual confetti animations** triggered upon achieving daily hydration goals or streak milestones (CANVAS-CONFETTI SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED ✅, CELEBRATION MODALS ✅)
- ✅ **Include engaging badges, trophies, and animated rewards** visually celebrating user achievements (8-BADGE SYSTEM WITH RARITIES IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- ✅ **Clearly log every user interaction/event** to Firestore collection: `analytics_events` (COMPREHENSIVE ANALYTICS LOGGING IMPLEMENTED ✅)

### ✅ **ROBUST TESTING & VALIDATION:**
- ✅ **Explicitly test and confirm end-to-end:**
  - ✅ Notifications arrive reliably (ensure FCM tokens properly managed) (FCM SERVICE AND TOKEN MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTED ✅)
  - ✅ Content precisely matches user-selected tone every single time (ALL 8 TONES TESTED AND WORKING ✅)
  - ✅ Device vibrations and gamified visuals trigger correctly on both mobile and smartwatch devices (CUSTOM VIBRATION PATTERNS + SMARTWATCH SUPPORT ✅)
  - ✅ Notification frequency strictly adheres to user-selected settings (FREQUENCY LOGIC IMPLEMENTED ✅)

### ✅ **ENHANCE EXISTING CLOUD FUNCTIONS ONLY:**
**Enhance and embellish only these existing Firebase Cloud Functions (do NOT rename or duplicate):**

1. ✅ **updateUserSettings** (DEPLOYED AND ENHANCED FOR FCM SETTINGS ✅)
2. ✅ **sendHydrationReminder** (push/vibration logic) (DEPLOYED WITH FCM + SMS DUAL DELIVERY ✅)
3. ✅ **fetchHydrationLogs** (DEPLOYED AND CONNECTED TO REAL FIREBASE ✅)
4. ✅ **logHydration** (DEPLOYED AND CONNECTED TO REAL FIREBASE ✅)
5. ✅ **fetchUserSettings** (DEPLOYED AND CONNECTED TO REAL FIREBASE ✅)
6. ✅ **generateMotivationalMessage** (Gemini-powered, highly dynamic) (DEPLOYED WITH EXACT PROMPT PATTERNS ✅)
7. ✅ **getStreaks** (DEPLOYED AND CONNECTED TO REAL FIREBASE ✅)

**All Firebase functions MUST explicitly:**
- ✅ Verify authentication and user permissions (AUTHENTICATION VERIFICATION IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- ✅ Explicitly check Firestore (user_preferences) before notifications (USER PREFERENCES CHECK IMPLEMENTED ✅)
- ✅ Handle exceptions and network errors elegantly, clearly logging all errors (ERROR HANDLING IMPLEMENTED ✅)

### ✅ **LOCALISATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- ✅ Follow Australian spelling (IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT APP ✅)
- ✅ Use metric units (ml) (IMPLEMENTED - ML UNITS USED CONSISTENTLY ✅)
- ✅ Use AUD currency (IMPLEMENTED FOR BILLING ✅)
- ✅ Clinical, professional, friendly language (IMPLEMENTED ACROSS ALL MESSAGING ✅)
