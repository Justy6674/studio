**Last Updated:** January 29, 2025  
**Status:** HONEST ASSESSMENT - IMPLEMENTATION REQUIRED

Here's what a truly world-class Notification Settings screen should look and feel like—no code, just the specs you'd feed into Cursor or any designer/dev:

⸻

Settings → Notifications (Sectioned UI)
	1.	Master Switch
• Label: "Push Notifications"
• Control: iOS-style toggle top of page
• Description sub-text: "Receive hydration reminders on this device."
	2.	Notification Tone
• Control: horizontally-scrolling pill selector (multi-select or radio)
• Options: Funny | Kind | Motivational | Sarcastic | Strict | Supportive | Crass | Weight-loss
• Only active when Push is ON
	3.	Frequency & Timing
• Control: radio group "Frequency" → Minimal (1×/day) | Moderate (2–3×/day) | Frequent (4+×/day)
• "Time windows" chips → Morning (6–10 am) | Midday (10 am–2 pm) | Afternoon (2–6 pm) | Evening (6–10 pm)
• User checks any combination
	4.	Vibration
• Label: "Vibrate on Reminder"
• Control: toggle (ON/OFF)
• When ON, dropdown → Light | Medium | Heavy
	5.	SMS Reminders
• Label: "SMS Reminders"
• Control: toggle
• Sub-controls when ON:
	•	Max per day → stepper or dropdown: 1 | 2
	•	Tone → same pill selector as above

⸻

Layout & Interaction Guidelines
	•	Grouping: Each feature lives in its own card or accordion panel.
	•	Feedback: Tapping a toggle should instantly save locally (optimistic UI) and then persist to Firestore in the background—show a brief "Saved" toast.
	•	Disabled States: If Push is OFF, everything below is greyed out.
	•	Error Handling: If saving fails, banner at top: "Couldn't save your changes. Tap to retry."
	•	Mobile+Watch: On a watch or small screen use the same structure but collapse pill selectors into a picker.

⸻

What to Tell Cursor

Command (⌘K):
"Cursor, revamp the NotificationSettings screen:
	1.	Replace the current static preview with the Master Push toggle at top.
	2.	Add a 'Notification Tone' pill selector with the 8 options.
	3.	Insert a Frequency radio group (Minimal/Moderate/Frequent) plus Time window chips.
	4.	Add a Vibration toggle and Light/Medium/Heavy dropdown.
	5.	Add an SMS Reminders toggle with its own Max-per-day stepper and Tone selector.
	6.	Ensure everything is disabled/greyed out unless its parent toggle is enabled.
	7.	Hook each control into the user_preferences document using setDoc(..., { merge: true }).
	8.	Provide instant "Saved" feedback and a retry banner on failure.

Don't write explanations—just produce the updated UI component, wired up to Firestore via the existing prefs API.

When you run that in Cursor you should see:
	•	A diff opening NotificationSettings.tsx with your new JSX structure
	•	Auto-wired Firestore reads/writes for each control
	•	A preview pane showing live toggles
	•	A "Done" breadcrumb or confirmation once applied

⸻

That prompt is what you feed into Cursor via its command palette—and then you'll get a fully restructured settings component, not guesses.
