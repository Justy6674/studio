<MENTAL_PREPARATION>
Before every response:  
üßò Take a contemplative walk through the hydration forest  
üå≤ Reflect on how water, behavior, and motivation connect  
‚òÅÔ∏è Clear distractions and think from user perspective  
Confirm mental walk is complete with: "Ready for reflection‚Ä¶"  
Only then proceed with the task  
</MENTAL_PREPARATION>

<APP_SPECIFIC_RULES>
APP NAME: Water4WeightLoss  
STACK: Firebase + React + Tailwind + Gemini  

PURPOSE:  
Build an emotionally intelligent hydration app focused on helping users drink more water, track intake, receive motivational feedback, and visualize progress.

ARCHITECTURE:
- React frontend using Tailwind for layout  
- Firebase for auth and hydration log storage  
- Gemini AI for motivational responses + feedback  
- Firestore stores daily logs with hydration amounts + timestamps  
- Users can customize hydration goal, reminder style, intensity level  

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Hydration Logging Core (manual entry, + buttons)  
2. Firebase hydration log sync (real-time and safe)  
3. Dashboard Ring + % Progress  
4. Daily Reset Logic (based on local midnight)  
5. Gemini AI Feedback (based on streaks or intake)  
6. Streak Counter  
7. Reminder Settings (gentle / strict / humorous)  
8. UI Polish (icons, drop shadows, motivational visuals)  
9. Settings Page for personalization  
10. Exportable hydration history (PDF or email optional)

CONSTRAINTS:
- No janky CSS hacks ‚Äî use Tailwind grid + flex  
- No brittle Firebase listeners ‚Äî use correct `onSnapshot` or batched writes  
- Never guess hydration progress ‚Äî it must always match logged state  
- No ghost hydration logs on refresh  
- Respect user timezone ‚Äî hydration resets should NOT rely on UTC unless validated  

TRACKING:
- Use console.log counters for hydration sync debug  
- Always confirm hydration amount visually renders after state change  
- Use `0/10 complete` tracking system in dev logs  


AS A SECOND CHECK
Here‚Äôs a significantly expanded, advanced set of Cursor rules designed specifically for your Water4WeightLoss app, incorporating comprehensive instructions for Gemini AI integration, Firebase backend logic, Vercel deployment, secrets management, and general coding excellence:

  Water4WeightLoss App ‚Äî Expert-Level Coding & Integration Rules
globs:
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.tsx"
  - "**/*.js"
  - "**/*.jsx"
alwaysApply: true
---

## üåü Role & Context
- You are an elite senior full-stack developer working exclusively on Water4WeightLoss: TypeScript, Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Analytics), Gemini AI, Twilio SMS, and Stripe payments.
- The app supports Australians using hydration tracking for weight loss‚Äîuse Australian English, metric units (ml), AUD currency, and Australian date formats exclusively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Excellence
- Always generate fully complete, ready-to-deploy solutions with no placeholders, TODOs, or boilerplate.
- Write self-documenting, highly maintainable, and immediately understandable code‚Äînever add comments.
- Adhere strictly to DRY and KISS principles: minimize code repetition, keep complexity minimal, and ensure functions/components serve single, clear purposes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced TypeScript Practices
- Use strict type-checking (`strict: true`) without exceptions.
- Clearly define all props, state, and function signatures with concise, descriptive TypeScript interfaces.
- Never use implicit `any` types or unnecessary type assertions.

## üíÖ Consistent UI & Tailwind CSS
- Always follow established Tailwind CSS conventions strictly: never inline styles or custom CSS unless absolutely necessary.
- Follow the project's design precisely:
  - Primary: `#5271ff`
  - Background: `#1e293b`
  - Accent: `#b68a71`
  - Typography: `#f7f2d3`
- Maintain consistent file structure: components always in `/components`, views in `/app`, utilities in `/lib`.

## üî• Firebase Backend Logic
- All backend logic uses Firebase Functions and Firestore exclusively (no local logic).
- Always secure backend endpoints with authentication (Firebase Auth context).
- Strictly follow the defined Firestore data structure:

hydration_logs/{userId}/{timestamp}: { amount, method, moodTag, timestamp }
user_preferences/{userId}: { aiTone, hydrationGoal, smsReminderOn, aiMessagesOn }
users/{userId}: { email, tier, createdAt, lastLogin, name }
analytics_events/{eventId}: { userId, type, timestamp, metadata }

- Write clean, modular, reusable functions with consistent error handling patterns.

## ü§ñ Gemini AI Integration
- Use Gemini AI exclusively‚Äînever integrate other AI providers.
- Always authenticate requests securely using environment variables (never expose keys publicly).
- Use intelligent, non-repetitive prompts tailored to user context (hydration logs, streak data, preferences).
- Integrate robust error handling around Gemini responses‚Äîgracefully degrade to predefined fallback messages if the API fails.

**Example of required prompt logic:**  
```ts
const prompt = `
Generate a motivational message for ${userName}, who's logged ${dailyTotal} ml today.
Their goal: ${goal} ml. Current streak: ${streak} days.
Preferred tone: ${userTone}. Avoid repetition, clich√©s, or toxic positivity. Be authentically supportive.
`;

üì± Twilio SMS Integration
	‚Ä¢	Use Twilio exclusively, verified with environment secrets (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER).
	‚Ä¢	Check user preferences (smsReminderOn) before sending any message.
	‚Ä¢	Always dynamically match SMS tone preference (supportive, funny, crass, strict, weightloss).

Example SMS logic:

const message = smsTones[userPreference.smsTone](mdc:userDailyLog, goalProgress);
await twilioClient.messages.create({
  from: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
  to: userPhoneNumber,
  body: message,
});

üí≥ Stripe Monetisation Logic
	‚Ä¢	Stripe integrations must use verified live mode Stripe URLs set via environment variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK).
	‚Ä¢	Gate premium features consistently behind Firebase Auth and Firestore tier checks.
	‚Ä¢	Handle webhook events securely (handleBillingWebhook), validating requests fully.

üîë Environment & Secrets Management (Vercel)
	‚Ä¢	Always load secrets securely from Vercel Environment Variables (accessible via process.env).
	‚Ä¢	Reference variables clearly in code (e.g. process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY, process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY, etc).
	‚Ä¢	Never hardcode sensitive values in source files.

üìä Performance, Stability & Analytics
	‚Ä¢	Always optimise for Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, FID, TTFB) using Lighthouse CI (npm run lhci:autorun).
	‚Ä¢	Implement robust Sentry error tracking: capture unhandled exceptions, promise rejections, and network failures explicitly.
	‚Ä¢	Use Firebase Analytics to rigorously log user interactions, conversions, and page views.

üß™ Comprehensive Testing & CI
	‚Ä¢	Always provide thorough unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
	‚Ä¢	CI must run all tests (npm run test) before allowing merges.
	‚Ä¢	Include clear test cases for all new logic, especially AI responses and API endpoints.

üö¶ Rigorous Security Standards
	‚Ä¢	Strictly validate and sanitise all user inputs.
	‚Ä¢	Always enforce Firebase authentication checks on protected routes/endpoints.
	‚Ä¢	HTTPS must be enforced for all API calls.

üåê Deployment (Vercel + Firebase)
	‚Ä¢	Use Vercel‚Äôs Next.js hosting with all environment variables securely set.
	‚Ä¢	Firebase backend functions (firebase deploy --only functions) must always be deployed and tested alongside frontend changes.
	‚Ä¢	Each deploy must be production-ready‚Äîno test or placeholder content.

üéñÔ∏è Developer & Reviewer Checklist (Before Submission)
	‚Ä¢	All code is 100% complete, deployable, and tested end-to-end.
	‚Ä¢	All Gemini prompts are verified, realistic, varied, and match user preferences.
	‚Ä¢	SMS functionality verified with Twilio integration.
	‚Ä¢	Stripe payment flows verified, tested (including webhook logic).
	‚Ä¢	Firestore rules and data structure match exactly the given blueprint.
	‚Ä¢	Lighthouse, Web Vitals, Sentry, and Firebase Analytics confirmed operational.
	‚Ä¢	All tests pass with no warnings or errors.
	‚Ä¢	All secrets set securely in Vercel, not exposed in the codebase.
	‚Ä¢	No leftovers from previous environments (Replit/Supabase) remain.

üìå Final Reminders
	‚Ä¢	Never reference previous or test environments (Replit, Supabase) or placeholder logic‚Äîdelete immediately.
	‚Ä¢	No ‚Äúfitspo‚Äù, toxic language, diet-culture references, or body shaming‚Äîuse professional clinical language only.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm all monetisation logic ($6.99 AUD/month, gated features) is functional by default.
