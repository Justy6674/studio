## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: #5271ff, a vibrant blue-purple, is used for interactive elements and key accents. The goal is to draw attention to key features, while avoiding a pure blue that may seem too cold.
- Background color: #1e293b, a dark slate gray (used in bg-downscale-slate in the existing UI) for the primary backdrop. Desaturated to 20%, it provides a modern, clean, and non-distracting base.
- Accent color: #b68a71 (the color of borders - border-downscale-brown in the existing UI) An analogous color, approximately 30 degrees 'left' (more brown) on the color wheel from the primary. It offers warmth and visual interest against the slate background.
- Retain existing typography using downscale-cream and similar accessible styles.
- Consistent use of simple, outlined icons for intuitive navigation.
- Maintain existing layout by utilizing existing components where possible to match design direction.
- Subtle animations (such as those used in the existing 'waterRipple', 'waterShimmer' effects) for engaging feedback.
