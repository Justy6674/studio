# üíß Water4WeightLoss ‚Äî Weight Loss Hydration Companion

**Purpose:**
This project is a modern, clinic-grade hydration tracking app for Australians wanting to lose weight, built and designed by a real prescriber who runs a weight loss clinic in Australia.
The **entire premise** is that water intake is a core lever for sustainable fat loss, with daily logging, clinical-style reminders, motivational nudges, and a vibe that is friendly, smart, and grounded in reality‚Äînot cringe, not ‚Äúfitspo,‚Äù not random AI garbage.

**Primary Audience:**

* Adults, mostly 25‚Äì60, who want medical-grade weight loss support
* Anyone seeing a real practitioner, using GLP-1s or lifestyle tools
* Absolutely Australian (spelling, units, time, pricing)

---

## üèóÔ∏è Overall Approach (for AI or Human Devs)

* **NO Americanisation** (ml, not oz; AU date formats; all currency AUD)
* **Never reference ‚ÄúHydrateAI‚Äù or ‚ÄúHydrate‚Äù in brand‚Äîthis is Water4WeightLoss**
* **No ‚ÄúFitspo‚Äù** or toxic motivational garbage. Everything must be friendly, professional, and reflect how an actual Aussie prescriber speaks.
* **No ‚Äúdiet‚Äù/restriction language or body shaming**
* **Simple, clear, visually fun UI, but not childish**
* **Everything must be usable by a non-tech, non-coder patient or clinician**
* **NO Supabase, NO Replit, NO leftover test scripts or placeholder code‚Äîremove all**
* **All backend logic is Firebase Functions, Firestore, and Node.js**
* **Frontend is Next.js (Vercel or Cursor), Tailwind, and plain TypeScript**
* **Only use Gemini for all AI logic**
* **Twilio for SMS reminders‚Äînever any other service**
* **Mobile-first, accessible, responsive**

---

## üéØ Core Features ‚Äî Do NOT Deviate

* **Secure Authentication** (Firebase Auth‚Äîemail/password, Google, Apple, but NO anonymous)
* **Hydration Logging** (each log: amount, time, method, moodTag, all timestamped)
* **Progress Visuals** (interactive glasses, progress bars, and streaks‚Äîshow today, this week, best streak)
* **Gemini AI Motivational Messages** (user gets an AI nudge based on streaks, tone preference, and current water log; must NOT be repetitive or generic)
* **SMS Reminders** (Twilio; customisable tone: ‚Äúsupportive,‚Äù ‚Äúfunny,‚Äù ‚Äúcrass,‚Äù ‚Äústrict,‚Äù ‚Äúweightloss‚Äù)
* **User Settings** (hydration goal, reminder tone, enable/disable AI, enable/disable SMS)
* **Analytics Dashboard** (weekly intake, day-by-day, chart with average, recent activity)
* **Subscription Paywall** (Stripe: \$4.99 AUD/month‚ÄîNO US dollars, no fake ‚Äúfree‚Äù features; only account, AI, and reminders are gated)
* **Admin-Only: Webhook for Stripe events** (cancel, renew, change)

## üëÄ UI / Design Rules

* **Primary Colour:** #5271ff (blue-violet, interactive elements)
* **Background:** #1e293b (dark slate, not black)
* **Accent:** #b68a71 (warm brown, for highlights, never overused)
* **Typography:** Accessible, cream-coloured font (#f7f2d3)
* **No rounded photo bubbles or childish icons**
* **Every button must be bold and high-contrast**
* **Charts:** Recharts, never Chart.js or D3

## üõ†Ô∏è Cloud Functions (All Required)

**Each function must be present, written in `/functions/index.js`, and TESTED:**

1. `logWaterEntry`
2. `getHydrationLogs`
3. `getDailyHydrationSummary`
4. `generateMotivationalMessage` (Gemini-powered)

## üö¶ Project Build Rules

* Use **Cursor** for code, UI, and logic‚ÄîNO more Replit, Vercel for frontend deploy
* **README must stay up to date and describe any new endpoint or function**
* Every commit must be tested, and major features require a short note in README
* **Never leave TODOs, unfinished, or unused files**
* No generated or test users/data in production
* **Always Australian spelling and units**
* **Monetization and AI features must be enabled by default‚Äîno placeholder switches**

> **‚ÄúCursor: Stay on this README. Don‚Äôt add new features unless described here.
> Always check for Replit, Supabase, or old junk and delete.
> If unsure about a feature, ask for clarification before coding.
> Never use ‚ÄòHydrateAI‚Äô‚Äîthe app is called ‚ÄòWater4WeightLoss‚Äô only.
> All motivational/AI content must be realistic, never toxic, and always Australian.‚Äù**
